## Identifiers

- `subject` - The ID of the test subject
- `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Activity Labels

- `WALKING` (value 1): subject was walking during the test
- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
- `SITTING` (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
- `STANDING` (value 5): subject was standing during the test
- `LAYING` (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
